## Scripts
In this section, we present two scala scripts that have been executed over the Apache Sark engine during our evaluation.
In each of these scripts, the LiteMat and FullMat are executed on chains and trees of our generated transitive structures.
They correspond respectively to tr2LiteMatCHAIN.scala and tr2LiteMatTREE.scala
Note that in this scripts, a file representing the connected components on the data set are supposed to be available on HDFS.
